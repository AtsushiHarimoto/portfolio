# Issue Management System Design and Implementation

> **Type**: Workflow / Project Management

## Summary

A lightweight issue management system, similar to JIRA, that centralizes all development tasks, system bugs, and feature requests. It resolves the historical pain points of scattered scope management and confused entry points.

---

## Background

### Historical Pain Points

1. **Scattered Scope Management**: Each subsystem previously managed its own tasks within its `docs/scope/`, lacking a unified global view.
2. **Confused Task Entry Points**:
   - Too many miscellaneous items piling up in `workspace/ideas`.
   - Ad-hoc task requests from communication channels.
   - No standardized task intake and distribution hub.
3. **Lack of Tracking Mechanism**:
   - No seamless "TODO list" view.
   - Difficult to determine which tasks are in-progress, completed, or archived.
   - Historical tasks hard to retrieve and audit.

### Design Goals

- Centralize all tasks through a single point of entry.
- Implement a minimal state transition flow.
- Minimize operational overhead while enabling global search.
- Seamlessly integrate with the existing Scope management system.

## Detailed Design

### Directory Structure

```
workspace/
├── issues/                      # Unified issue management root
│   ├── README.md               # System usage guide and rules
│   ├── INBOX/                  # New task inbox (unassigned)
│   ├── TODO/                   # Backlog (planned, not started)
│   ├── DOING/                  # In progress
│   ├── DONE/                   # Completed (awaiting archive)
│   └── ARCHIVE/                # Historical archive (by month)
│       └── {YYYY-MM}/
├── dashboard/                   # Task statistics dashboard
│   └── README.md
└── progress/                    # Large task progress tracking
    └── {TASK_ID}_1.progress.md
```

### Unified Naming Convention

```
ISSUE-{SEQ}-{SCOPE}-{TYPE}-{SHORT_DESC}

Parameters:
- SEQ: Sequential number (001, 002...)
- SCOPE: API | WEB | GAME | TEST | META
- TYPE: BUG | FEAT | DOC | REFACTOR | TASK
- SHORT_DESC: 2-3 word concise description (English, snake_case)

Examples:
- ISSUE-042-GAME-BUG-save_load_fail
- ISSUE-043-WEB-FEAT-editor_ui
- ISSUE-044-META-DOC-workflow_update
```

### State Transition Matrix

```
INBOX -> TODO -> DOING -> DONE -> ARCHIVE/{month}/
```

### Standard Issue Directory Components

```
ISSUE-XXX-XXX-XXX-XXX/
├── README.md          # [Required] Task summary
├── 1.PLAN.md          # [Optional] In-depth architecture plan
├── 2.PROGRESS.md      # [Recommended] Execution progress log
└── VERIFY.md          # [Recommended] Acceptance and test records
```

### Supporting Workflows

1. **`/new_issue`**: Create a new issue
   - Collects requirement details via interactive Q&A.
   - Automatically assigns the next available sequence number.
   - Auto-generates standard directory and structured README.

2. **`/move_issue`**: Transition issue state
   - Supports fuzzy ID matching.
   - Automatically updates target README and state transition history.
   - Built-in state guards and failsafe reminders.

3. **`/list_issues`**: Query issue matrix
   - Supports multi-dimensional filtering (Status / Scope / Type / Priority).
   - Two display modes (summary / detailed).
   - Dashboard sync refresh capability.

4. **`/archive`**: Deep archive for issues and code
   - Supports three execution modes (Issues Only / Code Only / Full Archive).
   - Handles issues and scope dependencies simultaneously.
   - Performs association checks and offers batch archiving options.

### Dashboard Features

- Overall status distribution (task counts per state).
- Statistics by SCOPE.
- Statistics by TYPE.
- Recent activity log.
- Quick-link matrix.

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Estimated 5 minutes)

1. Create the `workspace/issues/` directory tree.
2. Write `issues/0.README.md` as the master guide.
3. Create `dashboard/0.README.md` as the dashboard baseline.
4. Pre-load a sample ISSUE as reference.

### Phase 2: Workflow Injection (Estimated 15 minutes)

1. Create `/new_issue` workflow.
2. Create `/move_issue` workflow.
3. Create `/list_issues` workflow.
4. Upgrade `/archive` workflow for system compatibility.

### Phase 3: Knowledge Base Alignment (Estimated 5 minutes)

1. Update `AGENTS.md` with the task management section.
2. Update `CLAUDE.md` with quick reference manual.
3. Build dedicated Claude Skills.

## Usage Examples

### Create New Issue

```
/new_issue
-> Triggers interactive Q&A to collect task details
-> System assigns ISSUE-{next sequence number}
-> Auto-generates directory and initial README
```

### State Transition

```
/move_issue
-> Enter task ID (supports partial ID matching)
-> Specify target state
-> System auto-updates archive and audit records
```

### Query Issues

```
/list_issues --status DOING --scope GAME
-> Lists all in-progress tasks in the GAME scope
-> Optionally trigger Dashboard data refresh
```

### Archive

```
/archive
-> Specify operation mode (Issues / Code / Full)
-> Auto-migrate to ARCHIVE/{month}/
-> Cascade-handle associated Scopes
```

## Use Cases

- **Daily development iteration**: Track the full development lifecycle end-to-end.
- **Bug management**: Manage bugs from report through resolution across their entire lifecycle.
- **Feature expansion**: Manage from ideation through spec convergence to code delivery.
- **Milestone project management**: Task allocation and progress monitoring for phased projects.
- **Team and Agent collaboration**: Establish clear task ownership and state accountability.

---

## System Advantages

1. **Single Source of Truth (SSOT)**: End information scattering; all tickets centrally managed.
2. **Minimal State Machine**: 5 state nodes; low cognitive and operational overhead.
3. **Consistent Naming**: Highly converged file naming and directory structure.
4. **Full Traceability**: Immutable transition history with linked documentation chains.
5. **High Automation**: Workflows cover the complete task lifecycle.
6. **Data Visualization**: Real-time status overview via Dashboard.

---

## Risks and Precautions

- **Strict naming rules**: `SHORT_DESC` must be English in snake_case format.
- **No state skipping**: Strongly discouraged to skip states (e.g., jumping from INBOX directly to DONE).
- **Regular archiving**: Run `/archive` at month-end to keep the system lightweight.
- **Complete README entries**: Ensure each ISSUE's README is fully populated with no information gaps.
- **Scope association check**: When archiving, always verify whether associated Scope directories need to be bundled.
