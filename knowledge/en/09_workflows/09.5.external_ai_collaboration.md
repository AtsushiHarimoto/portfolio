# External AI Collaboration Guide (GPT Projects Loop)

## Purpose

Establish a standardized process for converting high-level architecture recommendations or code review feedback from external AIs (such as ChatGPT Projects, Claude Projects) into concrete, actionable tasks for Antigravity.

## Feedback Inbox

All recommendation files from external AIs are stored in a centralized location:
`workspace/ideas/`

Recommended naming format:

- `YYYYMMDD_{Topic}.md`
- Examples: `20260103_ArchReview.md`, `20260104_RefactorPlan.md`

---

## Collaboration Flow

### 1. Export Context (Local -> External)

Use `/run-sync-docs` to generate a full documentation backup:

- `output/sync_{date}/game_docs.md` (frontend)
- `output/sync_{date}/api_test_tool_docs.md` (backend)
- ...

Upload these files to GPT Projects / Claude Projects.

### 2. Receive Recommendations (External -> Local)

After conducting analysis and discussion in the external AI, request a summary of recommendations.

**Prompt**:

```text
Please summarize our discussion and generate an execution checklist for the development agent (Antigravity).
Please include:
1. Change summary
2. Specific files involved
3. Detailed modification instructions or code snippets
```

Copy the external AI's full response and save it to `workspace/ideas/YYYYMMDD_{Topic}.md`.
(This directory is under git version control, serving as part of the decision record.)

### 3. Execute Tasks (Local Action)

Issue the following command in Antigravity:

> "Please review workspace/ideas/YYYYMMDD\_{Topic}.md, analyze the recommendations, and generate an implementation plan."

Antigravity will:

1. Read the feedback file
2. Extract Action Items
3. Generate a PLAN
4. Wait for user approval before executing (ACTION)

## Best Practices

- **Keep context in sync**: After every major change, re-run `/run-sync-docs` and update the external AI's knowledge base.
- **Use structured instructions**: When possible, ask the external AI to use Markdown Checklists or code blocks to list tasks, making them easier for Antigravity to parse.
