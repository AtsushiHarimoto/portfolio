## 0. Prologue: A Mission from Spirit World

Hey, hey! Yusuke, wake up! Lord Koenma has a new assignment!
The Moyin Group's "Dark Tournament" this time is on an unprecedented scale! Word is they've gathered top-tier technology from the Human World, Spirit World, and even Demon World to build the ultimate visual novel engine.
Our job is to figure out their power structure and how those dangerous "demons" (AI models) actually operate!

Here is the **tournament guide map** I've put together. Study it carefully -- your life may depend on it! Hiei and Kurama have already gone ahead to scout. Let's hurry and catch up!

## 1. Master Genkai's Dojo: Moyin Model Studio

**Analogy**: Spirit Wave training ground
**Location**: `workspace/knowledge/00_projects/moyin-model-studio`
**Visual Map**: [01.Reikai_Dojo.canvas](../00_projects/moyin-model-studio/01.Reikai_Dojo.canvas)

This place is like Master Genkai's dojo, filled with grueling trials. Ordinary spirit energy (data) cannot survive here!
It must go through **basic spirit training (Pipeline)** to purify impurities and extract pure spirit energy.
Then, inheriting the **Spirit Orbs (Base Models)** left by past champions, the final **secret technique transmission (Training)** begins.
Only those who pass through the **Trial Gate (Evaluation)** will master the "Spirit Wave" and become a formidable force!

- **Raw Data** -> **Spirit Aptitude**
- **Pipeline** -> **Basic Training**
- **LoRA/Model** -> **Spirit Wave Secret Technique**

## 2. Demon World Surgeon's Operating Room: Moyin ComfyUI

**Analogy**: Shigure's Club
**Location**: `workspace/knowledge/00_projects/moyin-comfyUI`
**Visual Map**: [01.Makai_Surgery.canvas](../00_projects/moyin-comfyUI/01.Makai_Surgery.canvas)

Whoa, this place feels eerie... This is demon surgeon Shigure's territory.
If contestants want to change their appearance or gain special abilities (generate images), they must come here for modification.
You submit a powerful **obsession (Prompt)** as the price, and Shigure designs a precise **surgical procedure (Workflow)**.
Sometimes various **demon power amplifiers (Custom Nodes)** are added, and then... boom! **Materialization (Generation)** complete!

- **Prompt** -> **Obsession / Price**
- **Workflow** -> **Surgical Procedure**
- **Image** -> **Modified Body**

## 3. Yoko Kurama's Demon Plant Garden: Index-TTS

**Analogy**: Summoning demon plants
**Location**: `workspace/knowledge/00_projects/index-tts`
**Visual Map**: [01.Kurama_Garden.canvas](../00_projects/index-tts/01.Kurama_Garden.canvas)

Shh... quiet. This is Kurama's secret garden.
Those seemingly beautiful plants are actually creatures from Demon World!
Kurama uses **memories of past lives (Reference Audio)** as a catalyst, injecting powerful **demon energy (Inference)**.
This produces **demon mimosa plants (Voice Cloning)** that can imitate any voice. Can you hear it? That captivating yet dangerous voice...

- **Reference Audio** -> **Summoning Catalyst**
- **Inference** -> **Demon Energy Infusion**
- **TTS Output** -> **Voice of the Demon Plant**

## 4. Koenma's Spirit World Arsenal: Skills

**Analogy**: Spirit World treasure vault
**Location**: `workspace/knowledge/00_projects/skills`
**Visual Map**: [01.Reikai_Tools.canvas](../00_projects/skills/01.Reikai_Tools.canvas)

These are support items that Koenma secretly lent us!
If you encounter a demon you cannot beat, grab one quickly!
Here you will find **Spirit Spectacles (Visualization)** that see through deception, **Demon Sealing Rings (Security)** that trap system bugs, and **Spirit Guns (Execution)** that blast problems away.
But remember to read the **manual (Docs)** first, or the items might go berserk!

- **Skill** -> **Spirit World Item**
- **Agent** -> **Spirit Detective**

## 5. The Dark Tournament Arena: Integrated Overview

**Analogy**: Hanging Neck Island Arena
**Visual Map**: [01.Dark_Tournament_Overview.canvas](./01.Dark_Tournament_Overview.canvas)

We have finally arrived at the finals arena!
All the training, modifications, and summons ultimately serve one purpose: to showcase power in the **arena (Game/Web)**.
Only the team that combines these powers flawlessly will win the final victory and have any wish granted!

So, Yusuke -- ready to raise some hell?
