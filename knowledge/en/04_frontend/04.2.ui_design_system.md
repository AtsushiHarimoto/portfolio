# 04.2. UI Style Guide

> **Type**: Design system & theming  
> **Focus**: Establish Moyin’s global visual language, document Glassmorphism techniques, show Tailwind utility examples, and outline 3D layout and anti-piracy safeguards.

## 1. Core visual vocabulary: Glassmorphism

Moyin’s aesthetic leans modern, airy, and dimensional. The visual signature is a “frosted glass” treatment built from three layered CSS effects:

1. **Translucent base**  
   - Dark theme: `bg-gray-900/60`  
   - Light theme: `bg-white/40`
2. **Optical blur**  
   - Apply `backdrop-blur-md` or `backdrop-blur-xl` so the background recedes and foreground typography maintains contrast.
3. **Edge highlight**  
   - Use a subtle border like `border border-white/10` or `border-blue-100/10` to suggest thickness and tactile depth.

## 2. Tailwind CSS utility kit

The following utility combinations are the building blocks of reusable Vue primitives:

### 2.1 Standard glass panel

Use this container for chat logs, settings tabs, or floating modals:

```html
<div
  class="bg-gray-800/50 backdrop-blur-xl border border-white/10 rounded-xl p-4 shadow-lg"
>
  <!-- content goes here -->
</div>
```

### 2.2 Glow CTA button

Primary calls-to-action (e.g., “Start Game” / “Submit”) should feature a rapid pink-to-indigo gradient plus hover glow:

```html
<button
  class="bg-gradient-to-r from-pink-500 to-blue-500 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg hover:brightness-110 transition-all duration-300"
>
  Execute
</button>
```

### 2.3 Focused input field

Dark backdrop with a pink ring on focus gives immediate feedback:

```html
<input
  class="bg-black/20 border border-white/10 rounded-lg px-4 py-2 text-white focus:border-pink-500 focus:ring-1 focus:ring-pink-500 outline-none transition-all"
  placeholder="Type a line..."
/><!-- /-->
```

## 3. Layout best practices

- **Tone down body copy contrast** – Pure white text on dark backgrounds causes halation. Use `text-gray-200` or `text-gray-300` for long-form copy to calm the glare.  
- **Honor negative space** – Maintain breathing room with `gap-4`, `p-6`, and `my-4` to avoid clutter.  
- **Responsive-first grids** – All grid layouts should collapse gracefully. Default to `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2` so elements reorganize on mobile.

## 4. Light Breeze variant (sunlit freshness)

This visual treatment serves branches like `moyin-novel`, where immersive, text-first reading matters:

- **Sky-blue gradient** – Replace heavy dark plates with `linear-gradient(135deg, #f0f9ff 0%, #bae6fd 100%)`.  
- **Jelly-like panels** – Increase opacity to `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)` and soften corners to `12px`.  
- **Dewy shadows** – Swap harsh charcoal shadows for airy `rgba(0, 50, 100, 0.05)` to keep the interface luminous.

---

## 5. WebGL & Three.js harmony

- **Glow alignment** – Match UI glow with Three.js shaders by at least applying Fresnel-aware `ShaderMaterial` highlights at the edges.  
- **Z-index isolation** – Lock the 3D canvas to `z-index: -1` with `pointer-events: none` so it never hijacks Vue interactions (clicks, scrolls, etc.).

---

## 6. Copyright fortification

1. **Disable text selection & context menu** – Use `-webkit-user-select: none` and intercept `contextmenu` events to block raw copying.  
2. **Debug tool resistance** – Block `F12`, `Ctrl+Shift+I`, and `Ctrl+U` via script to inhibit casual source inspection.  
3. **Dynamic watermarking** – Render canvas-based, low-opacity watermarks embedded with user IDs. Invisible to readers but traceable during leaks.

---

## 7. Component strategy

To avoid “shotgun surgery”, wrap these styles into high-cohesion Vue components:

- See `LoggerView.vue` for how the `.glass-panel` structure has already been encapsulated.  
- Long-term goal: build a library of highly parameterized primitives (`BaseButton`, `BaseCard`, `BaseModal`) so future work only requires prop declarations instead of raw Tailwind stacks.
